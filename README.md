# Shopping Cart Demo

I'm not the best will CSS and am planning on learning Tailwind in the future to help with that a bit.

Otherwise this is my first big project with React to help showcase my understanding.

I completed this demo website it around a day (short time frame developement :)

The main goal of the demo was to prove I understood React and could develop in a short time window. I feel as though I've accomplished both tasks.
